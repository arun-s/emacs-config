My Emacs Configuration Files
=====================================
I have used emacs for several years now, primarily for coding in c and python. Having built up my .emacs file over several years from various web resources, from reading up on the work done by smarter folks, I have been having a large .emacs file with both useful as well as stuff that has fallen into rot. Also, with using emacs across several computers, I now have several minor variations of the same .emacs file.

By placing my emacs and elisp files on github, this is my feeble attempt at getting more organized with perhaps the most use tool in my workplace.

I am trying to model my emacs configuration structure after http://github.com/falkor
